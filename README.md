_MUNI Stinks...Rate your ride!_

It's now very simple to rate anything from films and music to shared taxi rides and restaurants. Public transport has so far escaped such scrutiny. 

Puni addresses this problem, giving riders of San Francisco public transport ("Muni") the opportunity to rate their experience and share their Muni horror stories with others.

Application uses geolocation feature to determine user's current location and finds the nearest bus to the point. Also it's possible to manually choose the bus to rate by clicking on the route number's window and choosing from the pins with busses numbers on Google map. The pictures in the beamlights and driver window shows average busses ratings. Each ride is rated in terms of Smell, Cleanliness and Driver mood and users can submit their horror stories that happened during Muni ride. The app then shows leaderboard of the worst Muni route numbers and shows their ratings. 

External API [Proximobus](https://github.com/apparentlymart/proximobus) is used to determine Muni location in real time.
Integration with Google Maps added to show Muni locations.
